This allows for a structured approach where all related data can be fetched in a single query.

System Overview

1. Identity Data: This contains personal information, credentials, or reputation metrics.


2. Blockchain Transactions: This includes all transactions made by Felicia, along with the currencies used (like Azucar).


3. Market Analysis: This could provide insights into market trends, potentially using Candlestick currency data.



GraphQL Schema Design

Below is an example schema that supports the retrieval of Felicia Ann Kelley’s identity data and connected blockchain transactions and market analysis:

type User {
  id: ID!
  name: String!
  akaIdentity: MsAkaIdentity
  transactions: [Transaction]
  marketAnalysis: MarketAnalysis
}

type MsAkaIdentity {
  alias: String!
  verified: Boolean!
  reputationScore: Float
}

type Transaction {
  id: ID!
  amount: Float!
  currency: String!
  timestamp: String!
  transactionType: String!
}

type MarketAnalysis {
  priceTrends: [PriceTrend]
  candlestickData: [Candlestick]
}

type PriceTrend {
  date: String!
  averagePrice: Float!
  volume: Float!
}

type Candlestick {
  open: Float!
  close: Float!
  high: Float!
  low: Float!
  date: String!
}

type Query {
  getUser(id: ID!): User
}

Example GraphQL Query

This query will fetch Felicia Ann Kelley’s identity data, her transactions, and related market analysis in one go:

{
  getUser(id: "felicia123") {
    name
    akaIdentity {
      alias
      verified
      reputationScore
    }
    transactions {
      id
      amount
      currency
      timestamp
      transactionType
    }
    marketAnalysis {
      priceTrends {
        date
        averagePrice
        volume
      }
      candlestickData {
        open
        close
        high
        low
        date
      }
    }
  }
}
